# Code Structure

## Architecture
The application follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability through reusable components and adherence to Kotlin best practices.

### MVVM Architecture
- **Model**: Manages data and business logic, utilizing Firebase for authentication and a custom API for currency conversion.
- **View**: Displays data and captures user interactions.
- **ViewModel**: Serves as the intermediary between the Model and the View, facilitating data flow and UI updates.

# Firebase Integration

The app is heavily integrated with Firebase services:

- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Stores user data such as account details.

## Firebase Setup
To set up Firebase for your project, follow these steps:

1. Add your project to Firebase via the Firebase Console.
2. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in your app's `app/` directory.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.

## GitHub Integration

We use GitHub Actions to implement a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build and test
process. This helps ensure the integrity of the codebase and enables automated testing for new
commits or pull requests.

---

## Version Control Workflow

Feature Branching: Each new feature is developed in its own branch (e.g.,
feature/authentication).

Pull Requests: Before merging into the main branch, pull requests are reviewed and tested.
CI Pipeline: GitHub Actions run automated tests on every push to ensure the build is
successful.

# How to run app

1.git clone https://github.com/username/myopsc7312.git

2.Open the project in Android Studio.

3.Add your google-services.json file in the app/ directory.
 
4.Sync the Gradle files.

5.Run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.

# AI Usage

The use of AI in this project was very minimal, most usages of AI were to fix issues we had like
connecting the code to the API or Firebase.

## Conclusion
